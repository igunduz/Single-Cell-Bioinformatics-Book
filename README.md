# Single Cell Bioinformatics: From Technology to Analysis Methodologies 

These are my personal notes from the *Single-Cell Bioinformatics* course offered at Saarland University, taught by **Prof. Fabian M√ºller**.

The notes are organized by lecture topic and structured using [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/). Content is adapted from lecture slides, classroom discussions, and reference materials provided during the course.
