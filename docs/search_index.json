Single-cell sequencing was selected as the method of the year in 2013 by Nature. (2014) Ever since then, besides of the methodology and the algorithms, the popularity of the single-cell sequencing improved. However, why do we need to use a sequencing method focused on a single cell when we can have bulk sequencing data? FIGURE 1.1: 10X Genomics Molecular Profiling of Single-Cell vs Bulk Sequencing (2019) The short answer is the limitations of bulk sequencing. If you want to analyze the immune response profiles of different patients using blood samples, using bulk sequencing data may not be beneficial. Blood is a complex mixture of various cell types. The bulk sequencing averages all cells within the sample. As a result, the data you have will be the average expression profile of all cells in the sample. Single-cell sequencing technology allows profiling different cells in samples. In Table 1, the comparison between bulk and single-cell sequencing was given. TABLE 1.1: Properties of Bulk vs Single-Cell Sequencing Bulk Sequencing Single-Cell Sequencing Average gene expression from all cells Each cell acts as a unique sample Average might not be representative Rare cell types can be lost Cellular heterogeneity is masked Resolves cellular heterogeneity Data is dense Data can be sparse and noisy Is a more robost technology Increases statistical power Cell aggregates Can be costly References "],["single-cell-rna-seq-technologies.html", "Chapter 2 Single-Cell RNA-seq Technologies 2.1 Plate-Based SMART-seq 2.2 MARS-seq 2.3 Droplet Microfluidics (DROP-seq) 2.4 10X Genomics Chromium 2.5 Nanowell Platforms 2.6 Sample Indexing (Illumina) 2.7 Single-cell Combinatorial Indexing: sciRNA-seq", " Chapter 2 Single-Cell RNA-seq Technologies FIGURE 2.1: Explosion of scRNA-seq Throughput (2018) Technological advances increase the efficiency of single-cell sequencing methods while the cost decreases day by day. In this chapter, we will briefly go through some of the single-cell RNA-seq technologies. 2.1 Plate-Based SMART-seq 2.2 MARS-seq 2.3 Droplet Microfluidics (DROP-seq) FIGURE 2.2: Extraction and Processing of Single-Cell Transcriptomes by Drop-Seq (2015) DROP-seq enables high throughput profiling of thousands of individual cells in a short period of time by encapsulating each cell individually with a unique barcode in a droplet. The process takes place within a microfluidic device. FIGURE 2.3: Drop-Seq barcoding scheme After dissociating the complex tissue sample into individual cells, each cell is suspended in droplets with microparticle beads which deliver barcoded primers within a microfluidic device. When cells within the droplet are lysed, the mRNA of these cells is attached to microparticles.A set of beads are generated with the reverse transcription of mRNAs into cDNAs. These sets of beads are called STAMPs, single-cell transcriptomes attached to microparticles. Finally, an RNA-seq library with about 10,000 single-cell transcriptomes was constructed by barcode STAMPs amplifying. FIGURE 2.4: Sequence of primers on the microparticle Each barcoded primer bead contains an unique cell barcode and, an unique molecular identifiers (UMI)s along with the common PCR handle. The common PCR handle sequences used for PCR amplification after STAMPs formation. The cell barcodes are unique for each droplets, therefore, each microparticles contains primers with the same cell barcode. UMIs are unique barcodes to each transcript, UMIs are counted digitially to count unique number of mRNA transcripts. And, counting UMIs also removes the uncertainty of PCR duplicates from transcript copy numbers. Limitations of DROP-seq: Most of the droplets are empty and, very few of the droplets contains both a cell and microparticle. Thus, it is not an efficient method. 2.4 10X Genomics Chromium FIGURE 2.5: 10x Genomics Chromium scheme (2017) The 10X Genomics method is very similar to DROP-seq and, it is first described in (2017). First, the barcoded beads are mixed with the cell suspension. Then, the mixture is capsulated with the emulsion generated by oil. The microfluidic device and the barcoded beads of the 10X Genomics are engineered to increase the efficiency of barcoding cells. Therefore almost 90% of the droplets contain a cell and a barcoded bead. The main difference between the 10X Genomics Chromium and DROP-seq is the reverse transcription occurs within the droplets. After the amplification process, the transcriptomics library is constructed. For each lanes of a 10X Genomics Chromium chip, approximately 20,000 cells can be barcoded and sequenced simultaneously. Advantages of 10X Genomics Chromium: 10X Genomics is a commercial platform Data obtained is high-throughput Almost 10,000s reads per cell Fast, inexpensive 3 transcript sequencing Single-nucleus sequencing possible Less bias by cell morphology Only captures nuclear RNA 2.5 Nanowell Platforms 2.6 Sample Indexing (Illumina) 2.7 Single-cell Combinatorial Indexing: sciRNA-seq References "],["single-cell-rna-seq-data-processing-and-quality-control.html", "Chapter 3 Single-cell RNA-seq Data Processing and Quality Control 3.1 Cell Ranger Pipeline", " Chapter 3 Single-cell RNA-seq Data Processing and Quality Control In this chapter, we will go through quality control and processing methods for single-cell data. 3.1 Cell Ranger Pipeline FIGURE 3.1: Cell Ranger Pipeline (2019) In 10X Genomics workflow, which is the main workflow that is commonly used nowdays, Cell Ranger pipeline is used to process Chromium single-cell data to generating feature-barcode matrices, reading alignment, filtering, clustering and perform other secondary analysis methodologies. Cell Ranger identifies each sample, cell and molecule. Identification done by using sequencing barcodes (eg. Illumina i7 and i5 indices) for samples, cell-specific barcodes for cells and, UMIs for molecules. The typical Cell Ranger results looks like this: FIGURE 3.2: Cell Ranger Pipeline Results (2019) In the previous chapter, we mentioned that some of the droplets may contain no cells. In the qc summary report of the Cell Ranger pipeline, Cell Ranger predicts the number of cells within the inputed data and print the estimation in Estimated Number of Cells section. The Barcode Rank Plot indicates the droplets that contains bead but no cell with the grey color. To determine a cut-off and remove noisy data, bioinformaticians benefit from this plot. The Mapping section of the report indicates percantage of reads that is aligned successfully to the genome. HINT : If the mapping rate is low and, you are working with the pure data (eg. human data) that may indicate contamination. NOTE : Cell Ranger prints error, if there is a quality issue.
