Single-cell sequencing was selected as the method of the year in 2013 by Nature. (2014) Ever since then, besides of the methodology and the algorithms, the popularity of the single-cell sequencing improved. However, why do we need to use a sequencing method focused on a single cell when we can have bulk sequencing data? FIGURE 1.1: 10X Genomics Molecular Profiling of Single-Cell vs Bulk Sequencing The short answer is the limitations of bulk sequencing. Despite the higher cost and sparsity of single-cell sequencing, it can capture information that cannot be obtained from bulk sequencing. Especially in cases where cellular heterogeneity is extremely important such as cancer, using single-cell sequencing can be useful. In Table 1, the comparison between bulk and single-cell sequencing was given. Table 1: Bulk vs Single-Cell Sequencing Bulk Single-Cell Average gene expression from all cells Each cell acts as a unique sample Average might not be representative Rare cell types can be lost Cell aggregates Resolves cellular heterogeneity Data is dense Data can be sparse and noisy Robost Increases statistical power References "],["single-cell-rna-seq-technologies.html", "Chapter 2 Single-Cell RNA-seq Technologies 2.1 SMART-seq 2.2 MARS-seq 2.3 Droplet Microfluidics (DROP-seq) 2.4 10x Genomics Chromium 2.5 Nanowell Platforms 2.6 Sample Indexing (Illumina) 2.7 Single-cell Combinatorial Indexing: sciRNA-seq", " Chapter 2 Single-Cell RNA-seq Technologies FIGURE 2.1: Explosion of scRNA-seq Throughput (2018) Technological advances increase the efficiency of single-cell sequencing methods while the cost decreases day by day.
