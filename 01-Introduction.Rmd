#  Why Single-Cell Analysis?

Single-cell sequencing was selected as the method of the year in 2013 by Nature.
[-@Nature2013] Ever since then, besides of the methodology and the algorithms,
the popularity of the single-cell sequencing improved.  However, why do we need
to use a sequencing method focused on a single cell when we can have bulk
sequencing data?

```

The short answer is the limitations of bulk sequencing. If you want to analyze
the immune response profiles of different patients using blood samples, using
bulk sequencing data may not be beneficial. Blood is a complex mixture of
various cell types. The bulk sequencing averages all cells within the sample. As
a result, the data you have will be the average expression profile of all cells
in the sample. Single-cell sequencing technology allows profiling different
cells in samples. In Table 1, the comparison between bulk and single-cell
sequencing was given.

    Bulk Sequencing                           Single-Cell Sequencing 
------------------------------------   --------------------------------------
Average gene expression from all cells  Each cell acts as a unique sample
Average might not be representative     Rare cell types can be lost
Cellular heterogeneity is masked        Resolves cellular heterogeneity
Data is dense                           Data can be sparse and noisy
Is a more robost technology             Increases statistical power
Cell aggregates                         Can be costly
