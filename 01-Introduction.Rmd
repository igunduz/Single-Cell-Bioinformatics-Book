#  Why Single-Cell Analysis?

Single-cell sequencing was selected as the method of the year in 2013 by Nature.
[-@Nature2013] Ever since then, besides of the methodology and the algorithms,
the popularity of the single-cell sequencing improved.  However, why do we need
to use a sequencing method focused on a single cell when we can have bulk
sequencing data?

```{r echo=FALSE, mop, out.width='80%', fig.show='hold', fig.cap="10X Genomics Molecular Profiling of Single-Cell vs Bulk Sequencing"}

```

The short answer is the limitations of bulk sequencing. Despite the higher cost
and sparsity of single-cell sequencing, it can capture information that cannot
be obtained from bulk sequencing. Especially in cases where cellular
heterogeneity is extremely important such as cancer, using single-cell
sequencing can be useful. In Table 1, the comparison between bulk and
single-cell sequencing was given.


Table 1: Bulk vs Single-Cell Sequencing 

    Bulk                                         Single-Cell
------------------------------------   --------------------------------------
Average gene expression from all cells  Each cell acts as a unique sample
Average might not be representative     Rare cell types can be lost
Cell aggregates                         Resolves cellular heterogeneity
Dense Data                                   Can be sparse and noisy
