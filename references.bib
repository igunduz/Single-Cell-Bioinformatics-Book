abstract = {Measurement of the transcriptomes of single cells has been feasible for only a few years, but it has become an extremely popular assay. While many types of analysis can be carried out and various questions can be answered by single-cell RNA-seq, a central focus is the ability to survey the diversity of cell types in a sample. Unbiased and reproducible cataloging of gene expression patterns in distinct cell types requires large numbers of cells. Technological developments and protocol improvements have fueled consistent and exponential increases in the number of cells that can be studied in single-cell RNA-seq analyses. In this Perspective, we highlight the key technological developments that have enabled this growth in the data obtained from single-cell RNA-seq experiments.},

abstract = {Summary
Cells, the basic units of biological structure and function, vary broadly in type and state. Single-cell genomics can characterize cell identity and function, but limitations of ease and scale have prevented its broad application. Here we describe Drop-seq, a strategy for quickly profiling thousands of individual cells by separating them into nanoliter-sized aqueous droplets, associating a different barcode with each cell’s RNAs, and sequencing them all together. Drop-seq analyzes mRNA transcripts from thousands of individual cells simultaneously while remembering transcripts’ cell of origin. We analyzed transcriptomes from 44,808 mouse retinal cells and identified 39 transcriptionally distinct cell populations, creating a molecular atlas of gene expression for known retinal cell classes and novel candidate cell subtypes. Drop-seq will accelerate biological discovery by enabling routine transcriptional profiling at single-cell resolution.
